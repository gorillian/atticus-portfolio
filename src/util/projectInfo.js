      "As an artist, Atticus draws inspiration from his surroundings and environment. He started to notice these compositions in his community	and decided to document them. After capturing these compositions	through images, he began creating art inspired by these images and the concept of found compositions. Atticus’ artwork varies from collages and drawings to paintings. To further develop the concept and project of “Unnatural Compositions” Atticus teamed up with a local design studio from Utah “ET AL” to execute this project. Shirts were screen printed with Atticus’s artwork on them and a wall was built and placed in a rural	location acting as a tool to isolate the subject and magnify the art being displayed. ",
