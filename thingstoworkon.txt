Okay so atti is going to send me his about info, contact info, fix up his resume and send that.

next thing is his structure, we initally had planned to just throw all his pictures up on the landing page like how it is, but then i asked him if he would prefer it to be the work, have a description of the project and then have the individual photos of the single project and then be able to click on those to see the little bit more about the photo.
